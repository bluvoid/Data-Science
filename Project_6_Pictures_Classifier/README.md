# Pictures Classifier 

Dog Breeds recognition using different methods.    
Comparison between a classic method (SIFT) and 2 Neural Networks (CNN: VGG16 & RestNet50).

<b> - 20181018_Automatic_Pic_Annotation_Dog_Breed_Recognition_CLASSIC_Part1.ipynb:</b>    
This notebook is dedicated to the pictures pre processing and treatment with a 'classic' method, SIFT. 

<b> - 20181018_Automatic_Pic_Annotation_Dog_Breed_Recognition_CLASSIC_Part2_PCA_Clustering.ipynb:</b>    
This notebook is dedicated to the SIFT features clustering.    
It's a separated notebook due to environment compatibility.
